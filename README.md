## Overview

Here we have a basic trivia game about the Orlando Magic.
Once the page loads all you have to do is press the start 
button and the game begins. You will have 20 seconds to 
answer each question, if the countdown hits zero you 
will be marked as a unanswered. At the end of the game it
will give you the score of the correct, wrong, and unanswered.
It will also give you a reset button if you would like to try 
the game again and go for a better score.
